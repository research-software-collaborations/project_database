description: >
  The OSG offers an integrated software stack and infrastructure used
  by the High-Energy Physics community to meet their computational
  needs. Frontier Squid is part of this software stack and acts as an
  HTTP proxy, caching requests to improve network usage.  We seek a
  fellow to turn our existing single cache Kubernetes deployment into
  one that can scale horizontally using the same underlying storage for
  its cache.
