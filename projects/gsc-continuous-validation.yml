shortdescription: Refactor parts of the ATLAS Global Sequential Calibration for ATLAS, integrating tests for continuous validation
description: >
  The Monte Carlo-based Global Sequential Calibration (GSC) is a calibration step intended to correct differences in response between quark- & gluon-initiated jets.
  It is part of the jet calibration recommendations used by nearly every ATLAS analysis utilising jets.
  The candidate will contribute towards a more robust framework for semi-automated validation of newly derived calibrations of this kind.
  They will refactor parts of the code, making it more robust and less error-prone while improving the documentation.
  Tests will be added at various steps of the procedure to ensure that newly derived calibrations do not introduce any unphysical effects.
