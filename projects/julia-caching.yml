shortdescription: Develop HEP strategies for artefact caching in Julia to allow large scale running
description: >
  Julia is a promising language for high-energy physics as it combines the easy
  of use and ergonomics of dynamic languages such as Python, with the runtime
  speed of C or C++. One of Julia's features is that it uses a JIT (or
  just-ahead-of-time) compiler to target the specific architecture on which it
  is being run. This however, comes at the cost of the compilation time, meaning
  that the first pass through the code is slower. If Julia is to be adopted
  widely in high-energy physics, and run at large scales, then it is important
  to mitigate this cost by *pre-compiling* the Julia code to be used on the
  system and avoid the cost of recompiling on every node. This is accomplished
  by the use of the `DEPOT_PATH` setting. This will first be investigated on
  cluster systems at CERN, e.g., SWAN and lxbatch. Startup time and runtime will
  be investigated with increasingly large sets of jobs running. Then we shall
  extend our investigations to caching Julia code on CVMFS, which would allow
  scaling to running on the whole grid. Finally, we shall examine the
  possibility of precompiling artefacts for different microarchitectures, that
  would allow exploitation of the full power of modern CPUs in large scale
  heterogeneous systems.
