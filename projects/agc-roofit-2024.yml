shortdescription: Implement estimation of physics model parameters of the AGC with RooFit
description: >
  The IRIS-HEP Analysis Grand Challenge (AGC) is a realistic environment for
  investigating how high energy physics data analysis workflows scale to the
  demands of the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC). The project offers a blueprint
  for HEP analysis applications that can be implemented using different tools
  and approaches. One of the implementations offered is done with ROOT, the tool
  for storing, processing and data analysis used by LHC experiments. In
  particular, it demonstrates usage of the RDataFrame high-level interface for
  data analysis in the CMS ttbar OpenData application. At the same time, it
  lacks the final steps of the AGC workflow, which involve the estimation of
  physics model parameters from the output histograms using the maximum
  likelihood method. The objective of this project is adding those steps via
  RooFit, the tool provided by ROOT for statistical analysis and advanced
  fitting, showcasing the use of such tool in a Python environment.
