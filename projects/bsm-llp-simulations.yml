shortdescription: Development of simulation workflows for BSM LLPs at LHCb
description: >
  In this project, the candidate will become familiar with Monte Carlo (MC) simulations in the LHC environment, using generators such as Pythia and EvtGen, and will learn to work within the LHCb framework. They will learn to generate new physics scenarios concerning long-lived particles, particularly dark bosons and heavy neutral leptons. The software implementation of these models will be of general interest to the entire LHC community. Moreover, these simulations will be used to assess the physics performance of various trigger algorithms developed within the Allen framework and to determine LHCb's sensitivity to detecting these types of particles. New particles in a wide mass range, from 500 to 4500 MeV, and lifetimes between 10 ps and 2 ns, will be generated and analyzed to develop pioneering selection procedures for recognizing these signals during Run 3 of LHC data collection.
