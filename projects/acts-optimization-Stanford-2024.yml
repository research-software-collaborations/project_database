shortdescription: Developing an automatic parameter tuning pipeline for ACTS track reconstruction software framework
description: >
  Particle tracking in HEP constitutes a crucial and intricate segment of the overall event reconstruction process.
  The track reconstruction algorithms involve numerous configuration parameters that require meticulous fine-tuning
  to accurately accommodate the underlying detector and experimental conditions. Traditionally, these parameters are
  manually adjusted, presenting an opportunity for improvement. Introducing an automated parameter tuning pipeline
  can significantly enhance tracking performance. The open-source track reconstruction software framework known as
  "A Common Tracking Framework (ACTS)" offers a robust R&D platform with a well-organized tracking flow and support
  for multiple detector geometries. Our previous work within this domain focused on developing derivative-less
  auto-tuning techniques for track seeding and primary vertexing algorithms. The goal of the current project will
  be to further advance these efforts by researching and developing an optimization technique that is differentiable
  across the intricate tracking algorithms. Additionally, this project aims to establish a seamless pipeline that
  facilitates the application of these optimization techniques with minimal user concerns.
