shortdescription: Implementing CMS Combine Datacard Support in PyHS3
description: >
  [CMS Combine](https://cms-analysis.github.io/HiggsAnalysis-CombinedLimit/)
  is the statistical analysis tool used by the CMS experiment at the LHC
  for measurements and searches, built on top of RooFit and RooStats.
  [pyhs3](https://github.com/scipp-atlas/pyhs3) is a pure-Python
  implementation of the
  [HS3](https://github.com/hep-statistics-serialization-standard/hep-statistics-serialization-standard)
  (HEP Statistics Serialization Standard) specification for serializing
  and evaluating statistical models. Supporting CMS Combine datacards in
  pyhs3 requires implementing several missing probability distributions
  and mathematical functions, as tracked in
  [scipp-atlas/pyhs3#69](https://github.com/scipp-atlas/pyhs3/issues/69).
  The non-CMS-specific components, such as the Crystal Ball distribution,
  Bernstein polynomials, and histogram distributions, have already been
  implemented in pyhs3. However, the CMS-specific interpolation PDFs and
  the `roorecursivefraction_dist` function still need to be implemented.
  The project goal is to complete the implementation of the remaining
  CMS-specific components and cross-check all of pyhs3's CMS Combine
  datacard support against CMS Combine to ensure numerical agreement.
  Applicants are expected to have working experience with Python and
  basic knowledge of statistical analysis.

  This builds on a prior project in this program: "HS3 Support for Combine: Provide HS3 support for the Combine statistical analysis tool.".
