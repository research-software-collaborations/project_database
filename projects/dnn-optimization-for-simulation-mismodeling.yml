shortdescription: Building robust DNNs in the presence of detector mis-modeling
description: >
  Simulation mis-modeling can significantly impact the performance of a DNN
  model trained using simulated signal events against data background. Under
  such conditions, the model may treat mis-modeled features as signal/background
  discriminators, introducing large systematic effects.
  There are multiple ways to address this issue, such as training solely on data
  samples or modifying the loss function to include penalty terms for
  mis-modeled features. In this project, we will compare such methods to assess
  their relative performance and identify common trends.
  The project requires a solid understanding of machine learning algorithms and
  the tools used to build and train deep neural networks.
