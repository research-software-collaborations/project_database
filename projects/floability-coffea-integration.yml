shortdescription: Deploy example Coffea application in a Floability backpack.

description: >
  [Floability](https://floability.github.io/) is a tool that aims to
  facilitate the portable deployment of Jupyter notebooks that involve
  potentially complex scientific software environments and distributed
  workflows at scale. [Coffea](https://coffeateam.github.io/coffea/)
  is a software framework that enables physicists to analyze large
  datasets and is ammendable to integrating in a Jupyter notebook.
  This project aims to demonstrate the feasibility of deploying a
  coffea application within Floability. The work will likely involving
  coordinating with the Floability development team to add any
  necessary features to enable Coffea analyses activities, in
  particular around data access and management. The work will also
  likely involve writing examples and tutorials, and helping to train
  users.
