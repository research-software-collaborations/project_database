shortdescription: Optimizing automatic differentiation using activity analysis
description: |
  In mathematics and computer algebra, automatic differentiation (AD) is a set
  of techniques to numerically evaluate the derivative of a function specified
  by a computer program. Automatic differentiation is an alternative technique
  to Symbolic differentiation and Numerical differentiation (the method of
  finite differences).
  Clad is a source transformation based AD tool which can perform more advanced
  program optimization by implementing more sophisticated analyses because it
  has access to a rich program representation – the Clang AST. These optimizations
  investigate which parts of the computation graph are relevant for the AD rules.
  One such optimization is the To-Be-Recorded optimization which reduces the memory
  pressure to the clad tape data structure. TBR analysis is a part of an adjoint
  mode of AD. It finds variables whose present value is used in a derivative
  instruction and reduces the number of statements by not creating temporary variables
  for dependent variables that are being overwritten and not being used. Another
  optimization is the activity analysis optimization which discards all statements
  which are irrelevant for the generated code. That is, if the statements do not
  depend on the input/output variables of a routine in a differentiable way, they are
  ignored. The advantage is that this improves the performance of the generated code
  and reduces the phase space of features needed to be supported to enable
  differentiable STL, for example.
