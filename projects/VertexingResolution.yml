shortdescription: Overcoming Vertex Reconstruction Limitations under the High-Density HL-LHC Pileup Environment
description: >
  Current vertex reconstruction algorithms at the LHC show a significant loss of efficiency in high-density environments
  when the longitudinal separation between vertices falls below ~0.5 mm. The origin of this inefficiency is not well 
  understood. Given a typical vertex position resolution of ~50 μm, vertices separated by more than ~150 μm (~3σ) should, 
  in principle, be cleanly reconstructible. The observed performance degradation, therefore, points to limitations in the 
  reconstruction algorithms rather than to intrinsic detector resolution.
  This project aims to identify the root cause of this inefficiency and to develop an improved vertex reconstruction strategy 
  suitable for the high-pileup conditions expected at the High-Luminosity LHC. The first phase will perform a detailed 
  characterization of vertex reconstruction performance for nearby vertices as a function of their separation, with a particular 
  focus on events in which one of two close-by vertices fails to be reconstructed. This will include detailed event displays 
  and a step-by-step analysis of the vertex seeding and reconstruction chain in failure cases, in order to pinpoint the 
  algorithmic features responsible for inefficiency in resolving close-by vertices separated by more than 3σ from each other. 
  In the second phase, the insights gained from this study will be used to design and implement targeted algorithmic improvements, 
  with the goal of significantly enhancing vertex reconstruction efficiency in high-density pileup environments at the HL-LHC.
