shortdescription: Simulate the detector response to high energy particle collisions using graph neural networks

description: >
  Geometric deep learning and graph neural networks (GNNs) have proven to be especially
  successful for machine learning tasks such as classification and reconstruction for
  high energy physics (HEP) data, such as jets and calorimeter showers produced at the
  Large Hadron Collider. This project extends their application to the computationally
  costly task of simulations, building off of existing work in this area [1]. Possible
  and complementary research directions are: (1) conditional generation of jets using
  auxiliary conditioning networks [2-3]; (2) application to generator-level showering
  and hadronization simulations, and investigating merging schemes with hard matrix elements;
  (3) developing an attention-based architecture, which has recently found success in
  jet classification [4]; (4) applications to shower datasets [5-6].
