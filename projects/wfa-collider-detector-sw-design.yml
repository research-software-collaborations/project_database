shortdescription: Software infrastructure and detector layout exploration for detectors at future wakefield-based colliders
description: >
  Wafkefield-based acceleration techniques promised tens of GeV of acceleration in under a meter. Such concepts have been demonstrated in laboratories with single cells.
  Despite this promise, only recently a coordinated effort to study end-to-end a complete collider design based on such technology has started.
  Within this project, the question of what type of detector would be best suited to extract the best physics out of such very-high-energy electron-positron (or electron-electron, or photon-photon) collisions remains largely unexplored.
  In this project, you will help building up the software infrastructure, within the key4hep framework, that will allow such detailed studies and start exploring detector layout assumptions and their implications.
