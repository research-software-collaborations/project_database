shortdescription: Add S3 compatible access interface to Rucio
description: >
  [Rucio](https://rucio.cern.ch/) is an open source software framework that
  provides functionality to scientific collaborations to organize, manage,
  monitor, and access their distributed data and data flows across
  heterogeneous infrastructures.
  Rucio was originally developed to meet the requirements of the high-energy
  physics experiment ATLAS, and is continuously enhanced to support diverse
  scientific communities.
  Since 2016 Rucio has orchestrated multiple Exabytes of data access and data
  transfers globally.

  With this project we seek to enhance Rucio to support a new mechanism for
  analysis facilities, which are oriented towards object stores in order to
  provide a portable destination for HEP analyzers to store data products
  produced in their research in a portable, shareable and standardized way.
