shortdescription: Adapting a Machine Learning Algorithm for use in ACTS
description: >
  [PV-Finder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.04962) is a hybrid deep learning algorithm designed to identify the 
  locations of proton-proton collisions (primary vertices) in the Run 3 LHCb detector. The underlying structure
of the data and the approach to learning the locations of primary vertices may be useful for other detectors, 
including those at the LHC, such as ATLAS. The algorithm is approximately factorizable. Starting with reconstructed 
tracks, a kernel density estimator (KDE) can be calculated by a hand-written algorithm that reduces sparse point 
clouds of three dimensional track data to rich one dimensional data sets amenable to processing by a deep
convolutional network. This is called a kde-to-hist algorithm and its predicted histograms are easily interpreted 
by a heuristic algorithm. A separate tracks-to-kde algorithm uses track parameters evaluated at their points of closest 
approach to the beamline as input features and predicts an approximation to the KDE. These two algorithms can be merged and
the combined model trained to predict the easily interpreted histograms directly from track information. The incumbent will 
work under the joint supervision of Rocky Bala Garg and Lauren Tompkins
(ATLAS physicists and ACTS developers, Stanford), and Michael Sokoloff (an LHCb physicist,
Cincinnati) to adapt the pv-finder algorithms to process data generated by ACTS rather
than LHCb.
