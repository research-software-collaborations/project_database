shortdescription: Implement the CMS open data AGC analysis with RECAST and REANA
description: >
  [RECAST](https://iris-hep.org/projects/recast.html) is a platform for systematic interpretation of LHC searches. It reuses preserved analysis workflows from
  the LHC experiments, which is now possible with containerization and tools such as [REANA](http://reanahub.io). A yet unrealized component of the IRIS-HEP
  [Analysis Grand Challenge](https://agc.readthedocs.io/) (AGC) is reuse and reinterpretation of the analysis. This project would aim to preserve the AGC CMS
  open data analysis and the accompanying distributed infrastructure and implement a RECAST workflow allowing REANA integration with the AGC. A key challenge of
  the project is creating a preservation scheme for the associated Kubernetes distributed infrastructure.
