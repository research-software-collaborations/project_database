shortdescription: Towards an end-end ML event reconstruction algorithm

description: >

  The most common approach to reconstructing full scale events at general purpose detectors (such as ATLAS and CMS) 
  is a particleflow-like algorithm [1–3] which combines low-level information (PF-elements) from different sub-detectors to 
  reconstruct stable particles (PF-candidates). Attempts are being developed to improve upon the current PF-algorithm 
  with machine learning (ML) methods and improving particle reconstruction in general. Within CMS, work has been conducted [4] 
  to develop a graph neural network (GNN) model by the name MLPF [5] to reproduce the existing PF algorithm. The proposed 
  MLPF algorithm has the advantage of running on heterogeneous computing architectures and may be efficient when scaling up 
  to accommodate the high luminosity LHC upgrade. The current status of the MLPF model works by reconstructing high level 
  PF-candidates, in a supervised fashion [6], from low level PF-elements. These “low level inputs'' have already gone through
  several steps of reconstruction such as track reconstruction, and energy clustering. 
  
  Although each reconstruction step goes through several layers of development and validation, the optimization of each step 
  is done independently which is not ideal since, for example, the tracking and clustering steps may not be well optimized for 
  the final task if it is done separately from the full particle reconstruction. It is therefore interesting to explore an 
  ML-based algorithm capable of performing the reconstruction in one-shot, in an end-end fashion. The first step towards 
  this, is to train an MLPF-like model which takes as input the reconstructed tracks and, instead of the calorimeter clusters,
  the calorimeter cell energy deposits. 

  The project will entail the exploration of the CLIC dataset published here [7] which contains hit-based information in the 
  form of calorimeter energy deposits. Furthermore, the training of a GNN-based model, and possibly other models, and comparing 
  with the current state-of-the-art results of the cluster-based model.
