shortdescription: Semi supervised methods for event reconstruction at the LHC

description: >

  The most common approach to reconstructing full scale events at general purpose 
  detectors (such as ATLAS and CMS) is a particleflow-like algorithm [1–3] which 
  combines low-level information (PF-elements) from different sub-detectors to 
  reconstruct stable particles (PF-candidates). Attempts are being developed to 
  improve upon the current PF-algorithm with machine learning (ML) methods and 
  improving particle reconstruction in general. Within CMS, a work has been conducted 
  [4] to develop a graph neural network (GNN) model by the name MLPF [5] to reproduce 
  the existing PF algorithm. The proposed MLPF algorithm has the advantage of running 
  on heterogeneous computing architectures and may be efficient when scaling up to 
  accommodate the high luminosity LHC upgrade. MLPF works by reconstructing high 
  level PF candidates, in a supervised fashion [6], model from low level PF-elements.
  We propose to test new self-supervised learning (SSL) ideas, borrowed from computer 
  vision tasks, to pre-train the MLPF model before performing the downstream task of 
  event reconstruction. In particular, a method by the name VICReg [7] was developed 
  under the umbrella of contrastive SSL in computer vision. In the pre-training phase, 
  the algorithm relies on taking two views of the same image and learns to associate 
  their embeddings in some latent space. The aim is to learn efficient latent 
  representations before performing the downstream task. In the case of MLPF, a natural 
  way to think of two (or more) views of the same event is by considering the different 
  sub detector systems (e.g. track hits and calorimeter clusters). In addition, other 
  event augmentations, that are physics-motivated, may be considered (e.g. Lorentz boosts). 
  We expect that pre-training MLPF on a huge amount of unlabeled LHC data can provide 
  better performance, and better domain adaptation (e.g. from MC to data).
