shortdescription: Testing the Real Time Analysis at LHCb using data collected in 2022.
description: >
  In this project, the candidate will use data collected at the LHCb experiment in 2022 to test
  and compare the different machine learning algorithms used to select events,
  in addition to probing the performance of the new detector more generally.
  They will first develop a BDT-based machine learning algorithm to cleanly
  select the decay candidates of interest in 2022 data. Statistical subtraction
  techniques combined with likelihood estimations will be used to
  remove any remaining background contamination. The decay properties of these
  channels, depending on which machine learning algorithm was employed in the trig-
  ger, will then be compared and their agreement with simulated events examined.
  If needed, the existing trigger algorithms may be altered and improved.
  If time allows, the student will also have a first look at the angular distributions
  of the calibration channels being studied. Understanding such angular distributions
  are vital to the LHCb physics program.
