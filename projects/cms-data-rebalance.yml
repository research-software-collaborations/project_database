shortdescription: Adapting Rucio data rebalancing daemon for CMS use
description: >
  CMS data management relies on the open-source Rucio software framework to manage its data,
  which is stored at various sites around the world. A common challenge faced by the data management operators team
  is the overfilling of sites, either due to being targeted by specific physics data or from the gradual
  accumulation of data over time. Monitoring the capacity status of these sites and rebalancing data as needed
  is essential. To address such issues, the core Rucio team has developed a rebalancing daemon dedicated to
  managing data distribution across different sites. Originally designed for specific experiments,
  this rebalancing daemon contains code that is experiment-specific, limiting its applicability
  across diverse experiments or communities. Consequently, the main objective of this project is to
  refine the daemon to be experiment agnostic. Achieving this will enable the daemon to effectively
  serve not only CMS but also the broader Rucio community. This refinement process involves identifying
  and modifying any experiment-specific elements within the daemon, ensuring its seamless integration with
  CMS data management practices. Through this work, CMS will become more agile in maintaining balanced
  site storage, thereby avoiding scenarios where sites run out of space.
