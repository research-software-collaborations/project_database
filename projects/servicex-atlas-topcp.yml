shortdescription: Implement a standard ATLAS ntuple maker in a ServiceX transformer
description: >
  ATLAS has plans underway to develop standard ntuple dumpers for the PHYSLITE analysis data format, which include the possibility of dumping
  systematic uncertainties in a compact and efficient manner. This project is to encapsulate one of these dumpers in a ServiceX transformer
  to enable it to be used as a seamless way of accessing PHYSLITE data in analysis jobs in a columnar manner.
