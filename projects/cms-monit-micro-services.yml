shortdescription: To develop microservice architecture for CMS HTCondor Job Monitoring
description: >
  Current implementation of HTCondor Job Monitoring, internally known as Spider service, is a monolithic application which query HTCondor Schedds periodically.
  This implementation does not allow deployment in modern Kubernetes infrastructures with advantages like auto-scaling, resilience, self-healing, and so on.
  However, it can be separated into microservices responsible for “ClassAds calculation and conversion to JSON documents”, “transmitting results to ActiveMQ and
  OpenSearch without any duplicates” and “highly durable query management”. Such a microservice architecture will allow the use of appropriate languages like
  GoLang when it has advantages over Python. Moreover, intermediate monitoring pipelines can be integrated into this microservice architecture and it will drop
  the work-power needed for the services that produce monitoring outcomes using HTCondor Job Monitoring data
