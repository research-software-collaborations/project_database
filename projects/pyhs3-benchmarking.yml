shortdescription: Benchmarking and Optimizing Statistical Analysis for PyHS3
description: >
  [pyhs3](https://github.com/scipp-atlas/pyhs3) is a pure-Python implementation of the
  [HS3](https://github.com/hep-statistics-serialization-standard/hep-statistics-serialization-standard)
  (HEP Statistics Serialization Standard) specification for serializing and
  evaluating statistical models used in High Energy Physics analyses.
  As pyhs3 matures, it is critical to establish a robust benchmarking
  infrastructure to measure and track the performance of probability
  density function (pdf) evaluation and model fitting over time.
  The project goal is to develop a comprehensive benchmarking suite for
  pyhs3 that measures speed and memory usage of pdf evaluation, using
  tools such as line profiling to identify bottlenecks in critical code
  paths. Benchmarks should compare pyhs3 against existing implementations
  including [numba-stats](https://github.com/HDembinski/numba-stats),
  [ROOT](https://root.cern.ch/), [pyhf](https://pyhf.readthedocs.io/),
  and [zfit](https://zfit.readthedocs.io/), with the expectation that
  numerical results are in perfect agreement across all implementations.
  Beyond benchmarking, the project will optimize pyhs3's performance
  through techniques such as caching of intermediate results and other
  improvements identified through profiling. The benchmarking
  infrastructure should enable continuous performance tracking across
  releases, providing a reliable point of reference for detecting
  regressions and validating improvements. Applicants are expected to
  have working experience with Python and familiarity with profiling
  and benchmarking tools.
