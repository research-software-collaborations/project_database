shortdescription: Porting HEP-specific distributions to PyTensor
description: >
  High Energy Physics (HEP) analyses rely on a number of specialized
  probability distributions that are commonly used in statistical
  models built with [ROOT](https://root.cern.ch/) but are not
  available in general-purpose scientific Python libraries.
  [PyTensor](https://pytensor.readthedocs.io/) is the computational
  backend used by [PyMC](https://www.pymc.io/) for building and
  evaluating probabilistic models, and extending its distribution
  library with HEP-specific distributions benefits both the HEP
  and broader scientific Python communities.
  The project goal is to contribute HEP-specific distributions
  upstream to PyTensor's
  [distributions](https://github.com/pymc-devs/distributions)
  library, following the pattern established for the `Normal`
  distribution in
  [pymc-devs/distributions#1](https://github.com/pymc-devs/distributions/pull/1).
  Several of these distributions have already been implemented in
  [pyhs3](https://github.com/scipp-atlas/pyhs3) and need to be
  ported upstream. As a secondary goal, the project will explore
  replacing pyhs3's internal distribution implementations with the
  upstream PyTensor versions, reducing code duplication and
  maintenance burden. The scope of this secondary goal can be
  adjusted depending on the experience level and timeline of the
  fellow. Applicants are expected to have working experience with
  Python and familiarity with probability distributions.
