shortdescription: Leveraging Graph Neural Network to utilize graph input data produced by Line-Segment Tracking
description: >
  The increase of the pile-up in the upcoming HL-LHC will present a challenge
  to event reconstruction for the CMS experiment. The single largest
  contribution to the total reconstruction time comes from charged-particle
  tracking. Without algorithm innovation, the projected charged-particle
  reconstruction timing is projected to exponentially increase. This
  increase in timing in combination with the fact that the computational
  performance of single thread processors is plateauing, CMS Collaboration
  estimates that without algorithmic innovation the computing resource
  requirement will hit a factor 2 to 5 over the projected computing
  capabilities. This can seriously hinder physicists to publish timely
  scientific results.  This motivates a new approach in tracking to develop a
  new algorithm that are parallel in nature to alleviate problems of
  combinatorics, and also can leverage industry advancements in parallel
  computing such as the GPUs. In light of this, Line-Segment Tracking project
  started.  Line-Segment Tracking (LST) project leverages the CMS
  outer-tracker’s doublet modules to build mini-doublets (a pair of hits in
  each layer of the doublet layer) in parallel, and subsequently build
  line-segments via connecting consistent pair of mini-doublets across
  different logical layers of the tracker, all done on high-performance GPUs.
  Eventually, the line-segments are linked together iteratively to form a long
  chain of line-segments to produce list of track candidates.  The parallel
  nature of the LST algorithm allows the algorithm to naturally lends itself
  for GPU usage. The project has produced on-par performance with the existing
  tracking alternatives, and have been integrated to central CMS Software as a
  step towards production.  As LST algorithm creates line-segments and
  links them to create track candidates, a graph representation of hits and
  linking between them is naturally obtained. In other words, LST can also be
  thought of as a fast graph producing algorithm. The project will take the
  graph data and develop GNN models that classify linkings. We plan to
  integrate the GNN model to the LST algorithm to augment its capability to
  produce high-quality track candidates at a shorter time while keeping the
  same or better tracking performance. Also, a solution for a “one-shot”
  linking of long chains of line-segments in one algorithm instead of through
  iteration will also be studied.
  Estimated Timeline:
  Week 1/2: Understanding the preliminary LST GNN workflow for Line Segment classification
  Week 3: Creating example of running the Line Segment classification inference on C++ environment with TorchScript
  Week 4/5: Integrating the inference with LST’s CUDA code to run the inference on GNN
  Week 5: Validating the implementation in the LST framework
  Week 6/7: Performing optimization of utilizing the GNN inferences to measure performance gain in the efficiency metric of LST framework (i.e. efficiency, fake rate, and duplicate rate)
  Week 8/9: Perform large scale hyperparameter optimization to find best resulting model architectecture
  Week 10/11: Perform research and development of extending the ability to classify Triplets, and beyond, with the Line Graph transformation approach, which would enable “one-shot” inference
  Week 12: Wrap up the project, document and summarize the findings to allow for next steps
