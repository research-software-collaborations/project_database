shortdescription: Add Julia Interface to the [PODIO](https://github.com/aidasoft/podio) library.
description: >
  The project's main goal is to add a proper Julia back-end to [PODIO](https://github.com/aidasoft/podio).
  A previous Google Summer of Code [project](https://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/gsoc/blogs/2022/blog_PODIO_SoumilBaldota.html) worked on an early prototype, which showed the feasibility.
  The aim is to complete the feature set, and do thorough (performance) testing afterwards.
