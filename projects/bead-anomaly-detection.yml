shortdescription: Improving anomaly detection using enriched background representations via latent space ML models
description: >
  Several Large Hadron Collider (LHC) experiments are conducting searches aimed at detecting dark matter. 
  Unsupervised and semi-supervised learning outlier detection techniques are advantageous to these searches, 
  for casting a wide net on a variety of possibilities for how dark matter manifests, as they impose minimal 
  constraints from specific physics model details, but rather learn to separate characteristics of rare signals 
  starting from the knowledge of the background they’ve been trained on. Developing innovative search techniques 
  for probing dark matter signatures is crucial for broadening the DM search program at the LHC, and BEAD is a 
  Python package that uses deep learning based methods for anomaly detection in HEP data for such new physics 
  searches. BEAD has been designed with modularity in mind, to enable usage of various unsupervised latent 
  variable models for any task. The aim of this project would be to develop new approaches for background 
  enrichment with the end goal of improving anomaly detection performance for new physics searches.
