    Keeping the functionality of Uproot's accelerated reading through AwkwardForth, but
    making it more maintainable by removing mutable state/coding it in a functional style.
description: >
    Uproot is a Python library for reading and writing ROOT files (the most common file
    format in particle physics). While it is relatively fast at reading "columnar" data,
    either arrays of numbers or arrays of numbers that are grouped into variable-length
    lists, any other data type requires iteration, which is a performance limitation in
    the Python language. ("for" loops in Python are 100's of times slower than in compiled
    languages.) To improve this situation, we introduced a domain-specific language (DSL)
    called AwkwardForth, in which loops are much faster to execute than they are in Python
    (factors of 100's again). This language was created in 2021 (https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.13516)
    and added to Uproot in 2022 (https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02202). In the end, an example
    data structure (std::vector<std::vector<float>>) could be read 400× faster with
    AwkwardForth than with Python. Users of Uproot don't have to opt in or change their
    code, it just runs faster.

    That would be the end of the story, except that the AwkwardForth-generating code in
    Uproot has been very hard to maintain. In part, it's because it's doing something
    complicated: generating code that runs later or generating code that generates code
    that runs later. But it is also more complicated than it needs to be, with Python
    objects that change their own attributes in arbitrary ways as information about what
    AwkwardForth needs to be generated accumulates. The code would be much easier to read
    and reason about if it were stateless or append-only (see: functional programming),
    and it easily could be. This project would be to restructure the AwkwardForth-generating
    code in a functional style, to "remove the moving parts."

    To be clear, the project will not require you to understand the AwkwardForth that is
    being generated (though that's not a bad thing), and it will not require you to figure
    out how to generate the right AwkwardForth for a given data type. This part of the problem
    has been solved and there are many unit tests that can check correctness, to allow you to
    do test-driven development. The project is about software engineering: how to structure
    code so that it can be read and understood, while keeping the problem-solving aspect
    unchanged.
