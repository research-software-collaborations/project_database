shortdescription: Explore the addition of a Rust interface to the [PODIO](https://github.com/aidasoft/podio) library.
description: >
  The project's main goal is to prototype a Rust interface to the PODIO library. Data models in PODIO are declared with a simple programming-language agnostic syntax. In this project
  we will explore how the PODIO data model concepts can be mapped best onto Rust. At the same time, we will investigate how much Rust's macro system can support the function of PODIO.
  For the other supported languages Python, C++ and (experimentally) Julia PODIO generates all of the source code. With proper usage of Rust macros this code generation could be kept to a minimum.
