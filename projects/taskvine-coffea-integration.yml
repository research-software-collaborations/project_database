shortdescription: Improving integrating Taskvine as a scale-out mechanism for Coffea

description: >
  [Taskvine](https://ccl.cse.nd.edu/softwares/taskvine/) allows users
  to schedule and manage tasks that run on batch systems and clouds,
  including HPC sites and GPU clusters. Taskvine can already be used
  to distribute analysis tasks in the
  [coffea](https://coffeateam.github.io/coffea/) framework. This
  project focuses on improving the integration, including usage of
  Vine Reduce and DAGs in TaskVine. There is also the possibility to
  work on task monitoring and visualization of task data both via CLI
  and within Jupyter notebooks
