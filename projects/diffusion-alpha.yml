shortdescription: Build, train, and tune a point-cloud diffusion model for the Active-Target Time Projection Chamber
description: >
  This project aims to build a conditional point-cloud diffusion model to simulate detector response to events in time projection
  chambers (TPCs), with a focus on the Active-Target Time Projection Chamber (AT-TPC). Current analysis and simulation
  software is currently unable to model the noise signature in the AT-TPC. Prior explorations have successfully modeled this noise
  in a cycle-GAN, but in a lower-dimensional space than the detector resolution. The IRIS-HEP project will be completed
  in collaboration with the ALPhA research group at Davidson College.

  The applicant should have a foundation in ML and a comfort in python. This is a newer type of ML deep learning generative
  architecture, which will require the applicant to read, implement, and
  modify approaches taken in ML literature using pytorch or tensorflow.
