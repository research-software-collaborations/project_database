shortdescription: Data Popularity, Placement Optimization and Storage Usage Effectiveness at the Data Center
description: >
  The goal of this project is to take data management to the next level by employing machine
  learning methods to create a precise data use prediction model. This model applied to data placement 
  decisions can bring important benefits both 1) to data center in dealing with large amounts of “cold,” or unused data,
  which can potentially become “hot”, or popular and heavily used, and 2) to scientists, by enabling them to access their data more quickly. 
  Deploying such models in production have many challenges and pitfalls like the accuracy of the predictions at different scales.
