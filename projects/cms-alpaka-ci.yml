shortdescription: Improvement and optimization of the CI job generator for the alpaka library

description: >
  alpaka is an abstraction library that allows writing a function once and
  executed on different accelerators, e.g. on different CPU (x86, ARM, RISC V)
  or GPU architectures (Nvidia, AMD, Intel). Therefore, the library must
  support a wide range of different build tools and runtime libraries in
  different versions. At the moment, we could test 2,500,000 different
  combinations of software dependencies in our CI, which would take
  months for a single commit.

  To reduce the number of jobs and also save the time for manually adding new software
  dependency combinations, we implemented a
  [CI job generator](https://github.com/alpaka-group/alpaka/blob/develop/script/job_generator/job_generator.py)
  written in Python using [pair-wise testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-pairs_testing).
  The generator reduces the number of jobs to about 170. Unfortunately, we encountered several
  problems and limitations when using the generator. The biggest problem is to check whether
  all expected test pairs are generated. Therefore, we have started to rewrite the
  [generator](https://github.com/alpaka-group/bashi) to solve all problems and ensure
  that it works as expected from the first commit by using strong test coverage.

  Your task is to finalize the work on the new version of the generator, migrate alpaka
  to the new generator and verify that the CI works as expected. The biggest challenge
  of the project is that trial and error does not work due to the immense number of
  combinations. Verifying that the generator works as expected is the main problem.
  Depending on the result of the migration, further optimizations are required.
  These can be simple optimizations, such as reducing the number of test parameters, but
  also clever optimizations inspired by HPC applications, such as an intelligent
  scheduling algorithm for the CI jobs to make better use of the CI resources and
  abort the CI as early as possible in case of broken code.
