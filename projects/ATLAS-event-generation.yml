shortdescription: Modernising Event Generation in ATLAS Athena
description: >
  This project will focus on improving event generation workflows within the ATLAS Athena software framework. The project aims to make configuration and metadata handling more robust and less error-prone, reduce reliance on user-specific settings, and align event generation with modern configuration patterns used elsewhere in Athena. The student will also explore updates that improve compatibility with multi-threaded execution and provide clean, well-documented example configurations. The project offers hands-on experience with large-scale HEP software, production workflows, and collaborative development in a flagship LHC experiment, while delivering practical improvements with direct impact on simulation and analysis.
