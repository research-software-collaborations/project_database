shortdescription: "Export Uproot data to all dataframes supported by Akimbo"
description: >
  Uproot's `library="pd"` indicates that the data should be read into
  Pandas DataFrames, rather than NumPy or Awkward Arrays, and it's
  implemented by invoking [Akimbo](https://github.com/intake/akimbo),
  formerly known as uproot-pandas, to convert Awkward Arrays into
  Apache Arrow and store them as Pandas columns with the Arrow
  dtype. However, Akimbo also supports dask.dataframe, Polars, and
  cuDF (GPU) dataframes. Polars has been requested (see
  [uproot#1096](https://github.com/scikit-hep/uproot5/issues/1096)),
  but all of these dataframes would be potentially useful.
