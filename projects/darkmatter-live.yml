shortdescription: Dark-Matter live
description: >
  This project will contribute to Dark-Matter-Live, an open, community-driven platform that unifies and visualises experimental constraints on dark matter models across collider, direct-detection, indirect-detection, and cosmological searches. The project will extend or refine the implementation of a well-defined dark matter model within the framework, validate selected experimental limits against published results, and improve interactive visualisations that enable transparent, side-by-side comparison of constraints in a consistent parameter space. In addition, the project will explore technical integration of Dark-Matter-Live with the HEPData portal, assessing how curated experimental results can be ingested, cross-referenced, and kept synchronised to enhance reproducibility.
