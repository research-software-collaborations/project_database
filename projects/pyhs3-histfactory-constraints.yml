shortdescription: Implementation of HistFactory Constraint Specifications for PyHS3
description: >
  The [HistFactory](https://cds.cern.ch/record/1456844) model is the
  standard statistical model used across LHC experiments for measurements
  and searches. It defines how observed data, signal and background
  predictions, and systematic uncertainties are combined into a
  likelihood function. A key component of the HistFactory model is
  the constraint term, which encodes prior knowledge about nuisance
  parameters representing systematic uncertainties.
  [pyhs3](https://github.com/scipp-atlas/pyhs3) is a pure-Python
  implementation of the
  [HS3](https://github.com/hep-statistics-serialization-standard/hep-statistics-serialization-standard)
  specification that aims to support the full HistFactory model. However,
  certain aspects of the constraint term specification that are allowed
  by the HS3 standard are not yet implemented. In particular, the use
  of alternative distributions for constraint terms (beyond the default
  Poisson and Gaussian) is a current blocker to fully supporting
  `histfactory_dist` distributions
  (see [scipp-atlas/pyhs3#109](https://github.com/scipp-atlas/pyhs3/issues/109)).
  The project goal is to implement the missing constraint term
  specifications in pyhs3 by studying existing implementations in
  ROOT and the mathematical formulations in published papers, building
  on initial work in
  [scipp-atlas/pyhs3#139](https://github.com/scipp-atlas/pyhs3/pull/139).
  Applicants are expected to have working experience with Python and
  basic knowledge of statistical analysis.
